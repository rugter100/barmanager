Barmanager!

A simple python program you can use to track the consumption of drinks within small friend groups or communities
Currently this system is mostly trust based but a web version based on payments will be made soon.
This tool is currently ONLY made for a self serve bar.

Will add better readme and better documentation when i have time

Currently you can download the program under the releases or 'compile' it yourself by using pyinstaller
